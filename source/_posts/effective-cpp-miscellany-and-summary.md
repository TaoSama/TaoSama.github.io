### Pay attention to compiler warnings

* be serious to compiler warnings.
* but shouldn't over rely on compiler warnings.

### Familiarize yourself with the standard library

### Summary

It is about 4 months since I started to read the book.
I'm so sorrow that I can't put the ways into practice, although it is quite fascinating.
What I'm eager to do is to write the beautiful code.
Keep patient, and what learned will settle.
