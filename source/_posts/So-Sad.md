Sooooo Sad! Nothing changes, am I wrong?
Defintely not, calm down for some time..

<!-- more -->

Well, many things to do... 
Which one get the most priority? Am I clear?

Am I really prepared? I'm afraid that something may follow the process of history..

Try to be more precise on some certain thing.

Any time, calm down.
The desire can lead you to the paradise and also the hell...

Think about myself. 
A Little afraid to failure... That's not what I want.

I wanna get my straightness and bravery back!

Well, all things will be OK.
